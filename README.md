# Getting Started with Good Reads App

This project is developed with [Create React App](https://zippy-kringle-284804.netlify.app/).

## How React Works?

  01. At its very core, React basically maintains a tree for and this  tree is able to do efficient diff computations on the nodes.
  02. React allows to effectively re-construct DOM in JavaScript and push only those changes to the DOM which have actually occurred.
  03. There's nothing like JSX - neither to JavaScript, nor to the browser. JSX is simply syntactic sugar for creating very specific JavaScript objects.
  04. When starts writing nested stuff, not only is this difficult to code, but it also becomes very inconvenient to maintain such a codebase. JSX thus helps bring the cleanliness of HTML to the power of JavaScript.

## Props Vs State

  01. Props are read-only. State changes can be asynchronous.
  02. Props are immutable. State is mutable.
  03. Props allow you to pass data from one component to other components as an argument. State holds information about the components.
  04. Stateless component can have Props.	Stateless components cannot have State.
  05. Props make components reusable.	State cannot make components reusable.
  06. Props are used to communicate between components.	States can be used for rendering dynamic changes with the component.
