# Getting Started with Good Reads App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How React Works?

  01. At its very core, React basically maintains a tree for. This  tree is able to do efficient diff computations on the nodes.
  02. React allows to effectively re-construct DOM in JavaScript and push only those changes to the DOM which have actually occurred.
  03. There's nothing like JSX - neither to JavaScript, nor to the browser. JSX is simply syntactic sugar for creating very specific JavaScript objects.
  04. When starts writing nested stuff, not only is this difficult to code, but it also becomes very inconvenient to maintain such a codebase. JSX thus helps bring the cleanliness of HTML to the power of JavaScript.


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
